      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p></p>

      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>
        I am from Sea Girt NJ, a small, literally one square mile, town at the
        Jersey Shore. It’s a great place to escape from city life to go to the
        beach, ride a bike or take a walk in a beautiful spot. At the entrance
        to town there is a big sign that states, “Smile, You’re in Sea Girt.”
        It’s home to the The Parker House, a pretty famous summer bar. In fact,
        the New York Times suggested it beats the Hamptons. There is also a
        great Italian specialty store, Joe Leones, that makes the most delicious
        mozzarella sandwiches in the world.

      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>
        I am an avid reader who enjoys escaping into a story. It fun being
        engrossed in the lives of various characters. Sometimes they “almost”
        feel like friends. I read a variety of books and I’m in a book club. I’m
        also a dancer and regularly enjoy Zumba classes with friends. Zumba is a
        60-minute cardio dance party which is so much fun you forget you’re
        working out. I recently started doing yoga regularly which is good for
        stretching and balance. I also enjoy the challenge of a large jigsaw
        puzzle and usually have one in progress on my coffee table.
      </p>

      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>
        I have a degree in Communications, but my background presents a very
        general set of skills. I always knew I needed to find my niche, a
        particular set of skills to market to employers. I am excited to enter a
        field with lots of room for learning, growth and ample job
        opportunities. I am still investigating specific job possibilities and
        seeking out companies whose work I value. I am certainly also
        considering the practical, salary and good benefits.
      </p>

      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>
        I live in NYC on the Upper West Side. I love living here because there’s
        always something fun to do, usually right in the neighborhood. It’s
        great that everything is just a short walk from home. Central Park is
        nearby which is the perfect place to enjoy nature. I’m a foodie, so I
        love exploring various restaurants with friends. Some of my favorites
        include The Ribbon, Sweet Greens, Tacombi and Magnolia Bakery for a
        sweet treat. On the weekends I always visit the local farm market to get
        fresh fruits and veggies for the week and stop by Shakespeare & Co., the
        local bookstore and café, for my favorite tea and to just peruse.
      </p>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>
        This past month I introduced myself to the field by taking an entry
        level class with SheCodes. The class covered HTML, CSS and Javascript. I
        found learning these languages to be fun and engaging. I believe coding
        plays to my strengths. I really like how VsCode shows the code in color.
        For me this makes it pleasant on the eye and helpful in finding errors.
        I really like that coding is project oriented. I have always enjoyed
        very structured work.
