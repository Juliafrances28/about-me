    <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
    <p class="aboutme">
      I am an avid reader who enjoys escaping into a story. It fun being
      engrossed in the lives of various characters. Sometimes they “almost”
      feel like friends. I read a variety of books and I’m in a book club. I’m
      also a dancer and regularly enjoy Zumba classes with friends. Zumba is a
      60-minute cardio dance party which is so much fun you forget you’re
      working out. I recently started doing yoga regularly which is good for
      stretching and balance. I also enjoy the challenge of a large jigsaw
      puzzle and usually have one in progress on my coffee table.
