      <p class="aboutme">
        I am a single woman who just turned 30 in February. I love dogs and recently my family got a Golden Retriever named Barley. Also love cupcakes of all kinds, but especially banana with chocolate icing. Fun fact, I have never had a cup
        of coffee.

      <h2>Where I'm From</h2>
      <p class="aboutme" >
        I am from Sea Girt NJ, a small, literally one square mile, town at the
        Jersey Shore. It’s a great place to escape from city life to go to the
        beach, ride a bike or take a walk in a beautiful spot. At the entrance
        to town there is a big sign that states, “Smile, You’re in Sea Girt.”
        It’s home to the The Parker House, a pretty famous summer bar. In fact,
        the New York Times suggested it beats the Hamptons. There is also a
        great Italian specialty store, Joe Leones, that makes the most delicious
        mozzarella sandwiches in the world.
      </p>
     
      <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
      <p class="aboutme">
        I am an avid reader who enjoys escaping into a story. It fun being
        engrossed in the lives of various characters. Sometimes they “almost”
        feel like friends. I read a variety of books and I’m in a book club. I’m
        also a dancer and regularly enjoy Zumba classes with friends. Zumba is a
        60-minute cardio dance party which is so much fun you forget you’re
        working out. I recently started doing yoga regularly which is good for
        stretching and balance. I also enjoy the challenge of a large jigsaw
        puzzle and usually have one in progress on my coffee table.

      <h2>Where do you live?</h2>
      <p class="aboutme">
        I live in NYC on the Upper West Side. I love living here because there’s
        always something fun to do, usually right in the neighborhood. It’s
        great that everything is just a short walk from home. Central Park is
        nearby which is the perfect place to enjoy nature. I’m a foodie, so I
        love exploring various restaurants with friends. Some of my favorites
        include The Ribbon, Sweet Greens, Tacombi and Magnolia Bakery for a
        sweet treat. On the weekends I always visit the local farm market to get
        fresh fruits and veggies for the week and stop by Shakespeare & Co., the
        local bookstore and café, for my favorite tea and to just peruse.
